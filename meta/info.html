    <h1>Thing Plus/Feather Template</h1>
    
    <p>
      This project template is the basis of an expansion board for the <a href="https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15667">SparkFun Thing Plus</a> and <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/3403">Adafruit Feather</a> form factors. It includes a PCB edge matching the outline of the Thing Plus PCB with connectors and mounting holes placed correctly to align the two boards. It also includes USB-C, Stemma QT/Qwiic, and battery connectors with their proper locations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note: due to the fact that the official 3D library does not include "long" or "stacking" female headers, the default Connector_PinSocket_2.54mm models were used.
